**hey there!** i'm an actuarial science major at [uiuc](https://illinois.edu/). i like to code, build stuff, and play chess from time to time; all-in-all, i love learning new things.

currently, i'm working on [the rising](https://therising.co/), a publication that covers how changes in the environment impact business, politics, and tech, machine learning research under [professor paris smaragdis](https://paris.cs.illinois.edu/), and will be joining my friend josh's awesome startup, [donotpay](https://paris.cs.illinois.edu/) this summer as a software engineer.

formerly, i've interned at [capital one](www.capitalone.com) as a software engineer on the machine learning platforms team, and at ucsf as a data science intern.
